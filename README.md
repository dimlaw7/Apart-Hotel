# Apart Hotel Application

This is a repo for one of the hotel websites I developed while learning to write cleaner and more structured react code. The main goal of the web applicatio is to create revenue for a five-star hotel establishment via direct online bookings or, indeed, by stimulating bookings via e-mail, as well as, to the projection of the hotel brand identity.

The website enables prospective guests to get an accurate information on the hotel services, vacation offers and more, making it possible to choose, order and (or) reserve the services of the hotel that leads to an informed booking decision.
